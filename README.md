# Shipyard: Declarative Delivery Automation Platform  
Shipyard is a declarative delivery platform that automates deployment policies, quality gates, and rollback strategies. Engineers can define deployment rules in YAML, test in sandboxed environments, and visualize workflows through a sleek React UI backed by Java and Node.js microservices.  

By combining declarative deployment definitions with real-time monitoring and rollback capabilities, Shipyard enables safe, reliable, and observable software delivery.

## Overview  
Shipyard allows teams to **automate and observe deployment workflows** while maintaining full control over policies and rollbacks.  

Its architecture includes:  
- **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS** for a clean, intuitive frontend  
- **Java (Spring Boot)** for the declarative rules engine  
- **Node.js** for API gateway and orchestration  
- **PostgreSQL** for policy storage  
- **etcd** for deployment state management  
- **Docker + Kubernetes + Helm** for containerized deployments and templating  
- **ArgoCD integration** for continuous delivery

## Why Use Shipyard  
Manual deployment processes are prone to errors and can be difficult to audit. Shipyard addresses this by:  

1. **Ensuring Reliability** → Automated rules reduce human error and enforce quality gates.  
2. **Improving Observability** → Visual dashboards show workflow progress and state.  
3. **Enabling Safe Rollbacks** → Quickly revert deployments in case of failure.  
4. **Streamlining Policies** → Declarative approach simplifies complex deployment workflows.  

---

## Target Users  
- **DevOps Engineers** → Automate and secure deployment workflows.  
- **SRE Teams** → Monitor and enforce operational quality gates.  
- **Developers** → Test deployments safely before production.  
- **Release Managers** → Control rollout policies and rollback strategies.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **Policy Definition** → Engineers define deployment rules in YAML files.  
2. **Sandbox Testing** → Rules are validated in isolated environments.  
3. **Deployment Execution** → Node.js gateway and Java engine orchestrate rollout.  
4. **Monitoring & Visualization** → React UI displays real-time workflow progress.  
5. **Rollback Management** → Automatic or manual rollback is triggered if rules fail.  

---

## Use Cases  
- **Enterprise Deployments** → Safely manage complex multi-service rollouts.  
- **Continuous Delivery** → Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.  
- **Compliance Auditing** → Maintain an auditable history of deployments and policies.  
- **DevOps Training** → Teach declarative deployment and rollback strategies interactively.  

---

## Future Plans  
1. **Multi-Cloud Support** for AWS, GCP, and Azure deployments.  
2. **Advanced Analytics** for deployment success/failure predictions.  
3. **Enhanced Policy Templates** for faster setup of common workflows.  
4. **AI-Driven Rollback Suggestions** based on historical deployment data.
